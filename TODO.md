Stanczyk is a work in progress project, and so it has a list of things I would like to complete before leaving it, again (or maybe not)

X Support `extern` keyword for C function and interop
- Add extra checks for extern, specially when returning values
- Support `var` creation
- Add an interpreter to simulate code execution (this will give it temporary Windows support)
