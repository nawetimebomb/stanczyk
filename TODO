#+TITLE: TODO

This file contains new features I need to work on and also bugs that are reported.

* Global symbols with text containing "if" "else" fail           :BUG:
When using a global symbol like the one below, the code fails to compile
#+BEGIN_SRC
:= go_if "if" .
#+END_SRC

* Strings do not support escaped characters                    :FEATURE:
* Add UTF-8 support to strings                                 :MAYBE:
