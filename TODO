#+TITLE: TODO

This file contains new features I need to work on and also bugs that are reported.

* Global symbols with text containing "if" "else" fail           :BUG:
When using a global symbol like the one below, the code fails to compile
#+BEGIN_SRC
:= go_if "if" .
#+END_SRC

* Strings do not support escaped characters                    :FEATURE:
* Add UTF-8 support to strings                                 :MAYBE:

* DONE Fix concatenated substractions [[file:tests/01-arithmetic.sk::;; -5 -3 - 2 - print ;; 0][example]] [[file:src/compiler.c::// TODO: This is buggy because it can't handle concatenated substractions][code]]               :BUG:

- State "DONE"       from              [2023-05-18 Thu 08:41]
:END:
Fixed by changing how negation works. Now we have the "neg" keyword that negates the next term,
that is, if the term is a Boolean acts like !Boolean, if the term is a number acts like -number.

This is closer to what Assembly does and also frees up the "-" and "!" characters.
